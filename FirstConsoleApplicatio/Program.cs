         * previous version
         * 
         * Distributed System:Every developer has a full copy of the repository.
         * 
         * Branching and Merging:Create isolated branches for 
         * features or fixes then merge.
         * Speed and Eficiency : Uses fast operations.
         * Back up:Every commit is saved providing full history.
